# LAT
â’¸ Llywelyn Hughes, Cardiff University. 2023
This Lattice Analysis Tool (LAT) software is a matlab-based application, which can also be run as a standalone software for non-matlab users. 
LAT has the capabilities to analyse any image format such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF & BMP with automatic scaled measurements of the area, diameter, perimeter and centroid of each region. The tool has been tailored for additively manufactured lattice structures but also successfully trialed for heat exchanger channels and nanodluidic particle analysis.


# Install
1. Matlab App: Open the LAT.mlappinstall file to automatically install the software into the matlab "My Apps" section.
2. Standalone Software: Download and install the LATInstaller_web.exe application
